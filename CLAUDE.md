# Project Sottovoce

<!-- This file is generated from docs/30_bible/CLAUDE.md_SEED.md. -->
<!-- Edit the seed, then copy here in the same commit. test_claude_md_synced.gd asserts they match. -->

An online multiplayer **social-stealth** game for 4–6 players in a Renaissance-Italian city
district. Every player holds a **contract** on one other player and is the contract of an unknown
third. The district holds 60–90 AI civilians, including 8–12 **identical clones** of each playable
persona. You must move slowly and civilianly to stay invisible, while hunting demands you close
distance and commit. Matches are 8 minutes, free-for-all, decided by **score**, not kills.

**The thesis, which every decision is measured against:** this is not a shooter with hiding. It
is a game about restraint, observation, and the terror of being watched. **Speed is a resource
that costs anonymity.**

---

## The six design laws

Violating one of these is a blocker, not a discussion.

1. **Speed is spent anonymity.** Any increase in velocity costs something the player values,
   immediately and legibly.
2. **The crowd is a mechanic, not a backdrop.** Every NPC behaviour produces information a player
   can act on.
3. **Every ability has a tell.** No ability resolves without the victim having had a perceivable
   chance to read it. No invisible instant-wins.
4. **Patience must be the strongest strategy, not merely the safest.** Hiding must *win matches*,
   not just keep you alive.
5. **The prey must have teeth.** Stun hard-counters a reckless hunter and is worth as much as a
   kill. Never weaken it.
6. **Uncertainty is authored, not accidental.** Where the game is imprecise, the imprecision is
   designed, bounded, deterministic and learnable.

## Tech constraints

| | |
|---|---|
| Engine | **Godot 4.7.1 stable**, Forward+ renderer. Version pinned in `.godot-version` |
| Language | **GDScript**. C# only for a *profiled* hotspot, with an ADR |
| Networking | Godot high-level multiplayer, `ENetMultiplayerPeer`, dedicated headless server, **server-authoritative** |
| Netcode | Server tick **30 Hz**; client input **60 Hz**; prediction for the **local pawn only**; snapshot interpolation **100 ms** for remotes; lag compensation **100–200 ms** for kill/stun only |
| Persistence | **None.** `IProfileStore` is stubbed |
| Matchmaking | **None.** Direct IP + `--server` |
| Platforms | Windows + Linux desktop, 1080p/60 |
| VCS | Git, LFS for binaries, **trunk-based** with short branches |

## Folder map

```
scripts/core/          PURE. No Node, no get_node, no autoloads. Unit-testable with no engine.
scripts/systems/       SERVER ONLY. Every rule that decides an outcome.
scripts/net/           Replication, RPC, prediction, interpolation, lag compensation.
scripts/pawn/          Shared server/client state machine. MUST be deterministic.
scripts/mirrors/       CLIENT. Read-only copies of replicated state.
scripts/presentation/  CLIENT ONLY. Camera, HUD, view models, audio. Excluded from server export.
scripts/server/        MatchDirector, headless entry.
scripts/debug/         Stripped from release.
data/tuning/default/   THE gameplay values. Every number lives here.
data/strings/en.csv    THE string table. No user-facing literal anywhere else.
test/arch/             Architecture guards. Do not delete these.
docs/                  The corpus. Start at docs/README.md.
```

**Dependencies point downward only:** Presentation → Net → Systems → Core. A system must never
reference anything in `scripts/presentation/`.

---

## Naming rules

| Thing | Rule | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Script | `snake_case.gd` matching its `class_name` | `SuspicionSystem` → `suspicion_system.gd` |
| Signal | **past-tense fact** | `contract_assigned`, never `on_contract` |
| Private | `_` prefix | `_rebuild_cycle()` |
| Tunable | `TUN-<DOMAIN>-<NAME>` → `<Domain>Tuning.<name>` | `TUN-SUSPICION-DECAY-BASE` → `SuspicionTuning.decay_base` |
| Test | subject's path with `test_` prefixed | `test/unit/core/math/test_suspicion_math.gd` |

**All IDs are immutable once merged.** Full grammar: `docs/30_bible/NAMING_AND_IDS.md`.

**Original names only.** Never use franchise terminology — see the never-do list below and
`docs/00_meta/IP_GUARDRAILS.md`. CI fails hard on any banned term anywhere in the repo.

## Commit convention

```
<type>(<scope>): <summary>

Why the change was needed. What was rejected and why, if anything was.
```

Types: `feat` `fix` `docs` `refactor` `test` `chore` `perf`.
Scope: a system slug (`compass`, `crowd`, `net`) or a doc section (`gdd`, `tdd`, `bible`).

Branches: `us/US-0042-compass-lock-arc`, `fix/<slug>`, `docs/<slug>`, `chore/<slug>`.
Target branch lifetime ≤ 2 days, hard ceiling 5. Squash merge. **Never push directly to `main`.**

---

## Never do this

1. **Never hardcode a gameplay constant.** Every number lives in `data/tuning/default/*.tres`
   with a `TUN-` ID in `docs/50_tuning/TUNABLES.md`. If changing it would change how the game
   plays or feels, it is a tunable.
2. **Never let the client be authoritative over an outcome.** No message may express "I killed
   X". Kill and stun are *buttons*, validated server-side against the lag-compensated world.
3. **Never predict gameplay state.** Only the local pawn's movement is predicted. Suspicion,
   tier, detection, contracts, cooldowns and score come from the server. A client-side suspicion
   estimate "just for the HUD" will drift, and a HUD that disagrees with the server is worse
   than no HUD.
4. **Never add an ability without a tell.** Two tell channels minimum, at least one environmental
   or audio, so it survives the victim not looking at the caster.
5. **Never use franchise terminology from the banned list** in `docs/00_meta/IP_GUARDRAILS.md`
   §2. Not in code, comments, commits, branch
   names, filenames or docs. CI fails hard.
6. **Never write a file over 400 lines or a function over 40.**
7. **Never call `get_node` from a widget** outside its own subtree. Widgets read view models;
   view models read the event bus.
8. **Never use `randf`/`randi` outside `scripts/presentation/`.** Gameplay randomness comes from
   the seeded `MatchContext.rng`, server-side only.
9. **Never call `Time.*`, `get_node`, `get_tree` or any autoload except `Tuning` inside
   `scripts/pawn/`.** That code is replayed during prediction reconciliation and must be
   deterministic.
10. **Never put a user-facing string in a script or scene.** It goes in `data/strings/en.csv`.
11. **Never add an asset without a licence row** in `docs/00_meta/ASSET_LICENSES.md`, in the same
    commit.
12. **Never add a minimap, a kill-cam, a global kill feed, player nameplates, or a hit-direction
    indicator.** These are permanent design laws, not backlog items. Each would convert an
    earned inference into a given fact.
13. **Never weaken stun** to make hunting feel better. If hunters are frustrated, make the
    *Anonymous approach* more reliable instead.
14. **Never reduce crowd density to fix performance** before exhausting the LOD ladder in
    `docs/20_tdd/08_crowd_system.md` §11.3. Density is the game's substrate.
15. **Never add an autoload.** There are eight. Adding a ninth requires an ADR.

## When to stop and ask

Halt and ask rather than guessing if:

- The work would require adding something outside `docs/00_meta/SCOPE_FENCE.md`'s IN list.
- Two documents contradict each other.
- A change would alter a `TUN-` value, a `SYS-` ID, or any merged ID.
- A test in `test/arch/` fails and the "fix" would be to weaken the test.
- The design intent is genuinely ambiguous and the readings imply materially different work.
- You are about to violate any item in the never-do list "just this once".

Full protocol: `docs/30_bible/AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md`.

## Where the work is right now

*Updated 2026-08-05. Keep this section current — it is the first thing a fresh
session reads, and a stale one is worse than none.*

**M0 IS COMPLETE. M1 IS 7 OF 12.** US-0013 to US-0019 are `status: done`.
**US-0020 is next** — the climb, drop and gap-jump states, the last three
traversal manoeuvres.

**THE PAWN WALKS AND VAULTS.** A key press reaches the speed ladder through the
real input map, the probes see the district, and pressing Space at a waist-high
wall puts the pawn on the far side. `test/integration/` asserts all three end to
end. Launch a client and drive it:

```bash
godot --headless -- --server --port 27015 --max-players 6
godot -- --connect 127.0.0.1:27015
```

WASD, Left Ctrl to blend-walk, Left Shift to run, double-tap Shift to sprint,
Space to vault. Space at a façade or an edge push_errors — `Climb` and `Drop`
are US-0020, and the noise is deliberate.
The camera is `DebugFollowCamera` — scaffolding in `scripts/debug/`, not
`SYS-CAMERA`, which is US-0021 to US-0023.

M1's gate is *subjective* (ROADMAP §3.1). **If the pawn does not feel good at
M1, it will not feel good at M6.** It is judgeable for the first time and has
not been judged — that needs a human at the controls, and the answer is not in
any test.

| | |
|---|---|
| CI | 7 jobs, green on `main`. `.ci/run_gut.sh` fails if a suite runs fewer scripts than exist on disk |
| Tests | 86 architecture guards + 241 unit + 45 integration, all three counted in CI |
| Tuning | 278 tunables across 14 resource classes; all 20 cross-field invariants assert |
| Autoloads | All eight. `Tuning` precomputes 89 durations into **two** tick tables — see trap 7 |
| Strings | `data/strings/en.csv`, 56 keys, no user-facing literal anywhere else |
| Boot | Branches on `--server`; 7 CLI flags parsed in pure Core; 5 export presets |
| Map | `MAP-VETRAIO` greybox, 120 × 120 m. Client loads 28 meshes, server loads none |
| Pawn | 15 states declared, 121 transition edges asserted against the normative diagram. **Ten implemented**: six locomotion + `Vault`, `KillAnim`, `Stunned`, `Blended`. Five are US-0020+ |
| Traversal | Probes cast, all seven §7.2 cases resolve from real geometry, both forgiveness windows open, and **vault and mantle perform**. `Climb` and `Drop` are US-0020 |
| Input | 21 `InputMap` actions from 15 `INPUT-` IDs, KBM + pad. Chain GDD-02 → `Ids` → `InputActions` → `project.godot`, guarded on every hop, both directions |

**Four criteria are deliberately unticked** in US-0002/3/4/5, all variants of
"required check on `main`". They are blocked by the GitHub plan, not by the work
— see §1.3 of `docs/20_tdd/12_build_and_ci.md`. The navmesh **bake** is likewise
owed and recorded in US-0012.

### Seven things that will cost you an hour if you do not know them

1. **Two things are GENERATED.** `scripts/core/ids.gd`, `scripts/core/tuning/*.gd`
   and `tuning_index.gd` come from `tools/tuning_codegen/run_all.py`; the map
   scenes and `MapData` come from `tools/generate_map_vetraio.gd`, whose single
   source is `scripts/core/vetraio_layout.gd`. Hand-edits to any of them are
   silently reverted on the next run. **Change the layout table, not the scene.**
2. **`duplicate(true)` does not deep-copy a `TuningProfile`.** The sections are
   *external* resources, and Godot's deep duplicate only copies embedded ones.
   Use `TuningProfile.clone()`. Getting this wrong writes to the live profile.
3. **Verify against `git archive HEAD`, not the working tree.** Git does not
   track empty directories, and a local pass proved nothing once already.
   **The extraction has no `.git`**, so anything reaching for git there gets
   nothing: `ip-guard` and `asset-inventory` both enumerated with `git ls-files`
   and printed "clean" over **zero of 739 files** for two milestones — vacuously
   green exactly where the checkpoint most trusted them. Both now enumerate
   through `.ci/repo_files.sh`, which falls back to `find` and refuses an empty
   list. TDD-12 §1.5. If you write a third guard, source that helper.
4. **The CLIENT scene is booted by a test now; the server scene is not.**
   `test/integration/test_client_boot_walks.gd` drives the real client through
   the real bindings. Everything else is still unbooted, and this trap has bitten
   twice: `change_scene_to_file` from `_ready()` failed with 92 tests green, and
   spawning through `transition()` into an unimplemented state failed with 222.
   **Run the game after touching anything scene-related.**
5. **OPENING THE GODOT EDITOR REWRITES `project.godot`** and deletes every key
   whose value matches an engine default, plus every comment. It did this once
   already, removing `rendering_method` and `physics_ticks_per_second`.
   `test_project_settings_pinned.gd` now catches it; the fix is
   `git checkout project.godot`. `--headless --editor` is safe; the GUI is not.
6. **`main` has no server-side protection** — see §1.3 of
   `docs/20_tdd/12_build_and_ci.md`. Run `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` in
   every fresh clone, and wait for a run to report `completed success` before
   merging. `gh run watch` can return while a run is still queued.
7. **THERE ARE TWO TICK DOMAINS.** `Tuning.ticks()` converts at the 30 Hz net
   tick; `Tuning.step_ticks()` converts at the 60 Hz input rate. Anything
   incremented inside `PawnState.step()` — `ctx.state_timer_ticks`, the action
   buffers — advances at 60 and must use `step_ticks`. Getting it wrong halves
   the duration *silently*, because both are plausible integers. Four merged
   call sites had it wrong until US-0016, including the stun freeze, which
   design law 5 forbids weakening. `test_step_counters_use_step_ticks.gd` now
   refuses `Tuning.ticks(` anywhere under `scripts/pawn/`.

### Local environment

Godot and gdtoolkit are not on `PATH` on this machine:

- `C:\Users\Slimex\Desktop\Godot_v4.7.1-stable_win64.exe`
- `C:\Users\Slimex\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python314\Scripts\gdlint.exe`

`.ci/run_gut.sh` invokes a bare `godot`, so shim it before running a suite:

```bash
printf '#!/usr/bin/env bash\nexec "/c/Users/Slimex/Desktop/Godot_v4.7.1-stable_win64.exe" "$@"\n' > /tmp/shim/godot
chmod +x /tmp/shim/godot
export PATH="/tmp/shim:/c/Users/Slimex/AppData/Roaming/Python/Python314/Scripts:$PATH"
```

## Fresh session? Read these four first

1. This file.
2. `docs/00_meta/GLOSSARY.md` — every term has exactly one meaning.
3. `docs/50_tuning/TUNABLES.md` — every number.
4. Your story file in `docs/40_backlog/stories/`.

Then the routing table above for the one or two documents governing your system. **Do not read
the whole corpus** — read the `depends_on` chain of what you need.
