# Project Sottovoce

An online multiplayer **social-stealth** game for 4–6 players in a Renaissance-Italian city
district. Every player holds a **contract** on one other player and is the contract of an unknown
third. The district holds 60–90 AI civilians, including 8–12 **identical clones** of each playable
persona. You must move slowly and civilianly to stay invisible, while hunting demands you close
distance and commit. Matches are 8 minutes, free-for-all, decided by **score**, not kills.

**The thesis, which every decision is measured against:** this is not a shooter with hiding. It
is a game about restraint, observation, and the terror of being watched. **Speed is a resource
that costs anonymity.**

---

## The six design laws

Violating one of these is a blocker, not a discussion.

1. **Speed is spent anonymity.** Any increase in velocity costs something the player values,
   immediately and legibly.
2. **The crowd is a mechanic, not a backdrop.** Every NPC behaviour produces information a player
   can act on.
3. **Every ability has a tell.** No ability resolves without the victim having had a perceivable
   chance to read it. No invisible instant-wins.
4. **Patience must be the strongest strategy, not merely the safest.** Hiding must *win matches*,
   not just keep you alive.
5. **The prey must have teeth.** Stun hard-counters a reckless hunter and is worth as much as a
   kill. Never weaken it.
6. **Uncertainty is authored, not accidental.** Where the game is imprecise, the imprecision is
   designed, bounded, deterministic and learnable.

## Tech constraints

| | |
|---|---|
| Engine | **Godot 4.5 stable**, Forward+ renderer. Version pinned in `.godot-version` |
| Language | **GDScript**. C# only for a *profiled* hotspot, with an ADR |
| Networking | Godot high-level multiplayer, `ENetMultiplayerPeer`, dedicated headless server, **server-authoritative** |
| Netcode | Server tick **30 Hz**; client input **60 Hz**; prediction for the **local pawn only**; snapshot interpolation **100 ms** for remotes; lag compensation **100–200 ms** for kill/stun only |
| Persistence | **None.** `IProfileStore` is stubbed |
| Matchmaking | **None.** Direct IP + `--server` |
| Platforms | Windows + Linux desktop, 1080p/60 |
| VCS | Git, LFS for binaries, **trunk-based** with short branches |

## Folder map

```
scripts/core/          PURE. No Node, no get_node, no autoloads. Unit-testable with no engine.
scripts/systems/       SERVER ONLY. Every rule that decides an outcome.
scripts/net/           Replication, RPC, prediction, interpolation, lag compensation.
scripts/pawn/          Shared server/client state machine. MUST be deterministic.
scripts/mirrors/       CLIENT. Read-only copies of replicated state.
scripts/presentation/  CLIENT ONLY. Camera, HUD, view models, audio. Excluded from server export.
scripts/server/        MatchDirector, headless entry.
scripts/debug/         Stripped from release.
data/tuning/default/   THE gameplay values. Every number lives here.
data/strings/en.csv    THE string table. No user-facing literal anywhere else.
test/arch/             Architecture guards. Do not delete these.
docs/                  The corpus. Start at docs/README.md.
```

**Dependencies point downward only:** Presentation → Net → Systems → Core. A system must never
reference anything in `scripts/presentation/`.

## Naming rules

| Thing | Rule | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Script | `snake_case.gd` matching its `class_name` | `SuspicionSystem` → `suspicion_system.gd` |
| Signal | **past-tense fact** | `contract_assigned`, never `on_contract` |
| Private | `_` prefix | `_rebuild_cycle()` |
| Tunable | `TUN-<DOMAIN>-<NAME>` → `<Domain>Tuning.<name>` | `TUN-SUSPICION-DECAY-BASE` → `SuspicionTuning.decay_base` |
| Test | subject's path with `test_` prefixed | `test/unit/core/math/test_suspicion_math.gd` |

**All IDs are immutable once merged.** Full grammar: `docs/30_bible/NAMING_AND_IDS.md`.

**Original names only.** Never use franchise terminology — see the never-do list below and
`docs/00_meta/IP_GUARDRAILS.md`. CI fails hard on any banned term anywhere in the repo.

## Commit convention

```
<type>(<scope>): <summary>

Why the change was needed. What was rejected and why, if anything was.
```

Types: `feat` `fix` `docs` `refactor` `test` `chore` `perf`.
Scope: a system slug (`compass`, `crowd`, `net`) or a doc section (`gdd`, `tdd`, `bible`).

Branches: `us/US-0042-compass-lock-arc`, `fix/<slug>`, `docs/<slug>`, `chore/<slug>`.
Target branch lifetime ≤ 2 days, hard ceiling 5. Squash merge. **Never push directly to `main`.**

---

## Never do this

1. **Never hardcode a gameplay constant.** Every number lives in `data/tuning/default/*.tres`
   with a `TUN-` ID in `docs/50_tuning/TUNABLES.md`. If changing it would change how the game
   plays or feels, it is a tunable.
2. **Never let the client be authoritative over an outcome.** No message may express "I killed
   X". Kill and stun are *buttons*, validated server-side against the lag-compensated world.
3. **Never predict gameplay state.** Only the local pawn's movement is predicted. Suspicion,
   tier, detection, contracts, cooldowns and score come from the server. A client-side suspicion
   estimate "just for the HUD" will drift, and a HUD that disagrees with the server is worse
   than no HUD.
4. **Never add an ability without a tell.** Two tell channels minimum, at least one environmental
   or audio, so it survives the victim not looking at the caster.
5. **Never use Ubisoft or other franchise terminology.** Not in code, comments, commits, branch
   names, filenames or docs. CI fails hard.
6. **Never write a file over 400 lines or a function over 40.**
7. **Never call `get_node` from a widget** outside its own subtree. Widgets read view models;
   view models read the event bus.
8. **Never use `randf`/`randi` outside `scripts/presentation/`.** Gameplay randomness comes from
   the seeded `MatchContext.rng`, server-side only.
9. **Never call `Time.*`, `get_node`, `get_tree` or any autoload except `Tuning` inside
   `scripts/pawn/`.** That code is replayed during prediction reconciliation and must be
   deterministic.
10. **Never put a user-facing string in a script or scene.** It goes in `data/strings/en.csv`.
11. **Never add an asset without a licence row** in `docs/00_meta/ASSET_LICENSES.md`, in the same
    commit.
12. **Never add a minimap, a kill-cam, a global kill feed, player nameplates, or a hit-direction
    indicator.** These are permanent design laws, not backlog items. Each would convert an
    earned inference into a given fact.
13. **Never weaken stun** to make hunting feel better. If hunters are frustrated, make the
    *Anonymous approach* more reliable instead.
14. **Never reduce crowd density to fix performance** before exhausting the LOD ladder in
    `docs/20_tdd/08_crowd_system.md` §11.3. Density is the game's substrate.
15. **Never add an autoload.** There are eight. Adding a ninth requires an ADR.

## When to stop and ask

Halt and ask rather than guessing if:

- The work would require adding something outside `docs/00_meta/SCOPE_FENCE.md`'s IN list.
- Two documents contradict each other.
- A change would alter a `TUN-` value, a `SYS-` ID, or any merged ID.
- A test in `test/arch/` fails and the "fix" would be to weaken the test.
- The design intent is genuinely ambiguous and the readings imply materially different work.
- You are about to violate any item in the never-do list "just this once".

Full protocol: `docs/30_bible/AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md`.

## Fresh session? Read these four first

1. This file.
2. `docs/00_meta/GLOSSARY.md` — every term has exactly one meaning.
3. `docs/50_tuning/TUNABLES.md` — every number.
4. Your story file in `docs/40_backlog/stories/`.

Then the routing table above for the one or two documents governing your system. **Do not read
the whole corpus** — read the `depends_on` chain of what you need.
